Workflow Steps

Synthetic Data Preparation

Since real data is unavailable, a dummy Excel file (reviews 2.xlsx) containing sample customer reviews is created.

Each row represents a fake review to mimic real customer feedback.

Data Import & Exploration

Load the dataset using pandas.

Inspect the structure (df.head(), df.info()) to ensure correct import.

Data Cleaning (Optional)

Remove null values or duplicates.

Normalize text (lowercasing, removing extra spaces).

Emotion Analysis using NRCLex

Use the NRCLex library to detect emotions (joy, sadness, anger, surprise, etc.) in each review.

The emotion scores are added as new columns to the DataFrame.

Visualization & Insights (Optional)

Plot sentiment distributions.

Identify the most common positive/negative emotions.
